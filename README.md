-Only run TarkBot with one monitor plugged in

-To kill program, repeatedly and rapidly move cursor into corners of screen (pygui) OR kill by closing opened cmd instance

-Unzip file. To run go to /dist/, then /tgui/, then run tgui.exe inside

-Don't edit any files or folders. Don't move anything around

-This is only lightly tested, so expect errors

-Currently designed for 1920x1080 screens, 1920x1080 game resolution, and in fullscreen. App is pixel specific so slight changes can cause fatal errors
