# TarkBotExe
Executable for tarkbot. Source code is currently private but available on request. Will make it public once I decide it's stable enough. First push is Beta V1.0.

09-18-22

-Only run TarkBot with one monitor plugged in

-To kill program, repeatedly and rapidly move cursor into corners of screen (pygui) OR kill by closing opened cmd instance

-Unzip file. To run go to /dist/, then /tgui/, then run tgui.exe inside

-Don't edit any files or folders. Don't move anything around

-This is only lightly tested, so expect errors

-Currently designed for 1920x1080 screens, 1920x1080 game resolution, and in fullscreen. App is pixel specific so slight changes can cause fatal errors

-Make sure EFT and BSGlauncher not tunning, and that you've already signed in to your BSG account. Will fail otherwise
