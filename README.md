Executable for TarkBot

Source code @ https://github.com/midscreant/TarkBot

<--------------------->

INSTALLATION:

  Download all files from master branch and extract. 
  
  EXE file is located in /dist/tgui/tgui.exe
  
  Should be ready to go out of the box.
  
  Running the exe will open a cmd prompt as well as the GUI.

<--------------------->

PREFACE:

This is made for 1920x1080 monitors.

This will not work if you have 2 monitors running.

This was designed to work with fully leveled hideouts.

May have unexpected behavior if you attempt to run nodes you don't have or create recipes you aren't high enough level for. 

The program will end itself if it finds it can't purchase certain items. It will also end itself if you don't have enough money. 

If you do not make sure you have enough money and the proper levels beforehand, the program may not work as intended.

IF YOU WANT TO KILL PROGRAM MIDRUN - Rapidly and repeatedly move the cursor to one of the four corners of monitor until program ends (~ 1 - 10 sec)

Moving the mouse can cause program to fail. Do not move during run unless you want to kill it

Between each part of a runthrough, there is a 10 second grace period to allow for any necessary onscreen interactions

By running this program, you allow the bot to use your in-game funds for purchases, re-organize your inventory as it sees fit, and consume items from your stash. 

I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY LOSS OF IN-GAME CURRENCY AND ITEMS

I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO PHYSICAL SYSTEMS

Do not reproduce or modify without permission 


<--------------------->

RUNNING THE BOT:

-GUI BUTTON GUIDE

  As a general rule, inserting a value of -1 to sections will run them indefinitely (with the exception of "Checkup Freq")

  -Preset
  
    -Set and delete presets in the top left (select option, then click "Insert" or "Delete"
    -Create new presets by filling out full form then naming and saving the preset in the "Preset Name" section
    
  -Time
  
    -How long you want the bot to run for (n * 15min)
    - -1 input will run indefinitely
    
  -Checkup Freq
  
    -How long in between hideout checkups. A break in between full runs (n * 15min)
    
  -Path to BSGLauncher.exe
  
    -Needs this to boot game on software start
    
  -Checkboxes
  
    -Enable Inventory Quicksort: Once every full run, bot attempts to quicksort inventory to make room
    -Enable Insurance Checks: Checks Prapor and Therapist for insurance items to claim
    -Enable Flea Checks: Checks Ragman for money or items to claim from the flea
    -Enable Reboot Attempts: On encountering a fatal error, the program attempts to reboot itself and start from where it left off. Does this up to 2 times
    
  -Nodes
    
    If run count or selection is left blank, won't run that node. Need to select both to run it.
  
    -Generator: Amount of fuel cans you're willing to add to generator
    -Water: Amount of water filters you're willing to buy (max)
    -Booze: Amount of booze you want to produce
    
    -Scav: Scav Case selction & run count per runthrough
    -Workbench: Workbench selction & run count per runthrough
    -Intel: Intel selction & run count per runthrough
    -Medstation: Medstation selction & run count per runthrough
    -Lavatory: Lavatory selction & run count per runthrough
    -Nutrition: Nutrition selction & run count per runthrough
    
Once "Time", "Checkup Freq", "Path to BSGLauncher.exe" and at least 1 node activty filled out, you can press "Start"

This brings up a confirmation window with all of your choices

Once confirmed, DO NOT TOUCH THE MOUSE UNLESS YOU ARE READY TO KILL PROGRAM

Tarkov will boot on its own

I would recommend watching the bot until it successfully opens the hideout for the first time. Can get hung up if game takes too long to load and will need to be restarted

<--------------------->

FINAL NOTES

In the future, I plan on adding mobile control options
Considered adding a "Sell On Flea" function, but seemed like it may violate EFT TOS

If you run into any bugs, feel free to let me know. This is a WIP and I don't expect it to run flawlessly.
