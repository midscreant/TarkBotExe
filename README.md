PREREQUISITES
<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>

-Only run TarkBot with one monitor plugged in

-To kill program, repeatedly and rapidly move cursor into corners of screen (pygui) OR kill by closing opened cmd instance

-Unzip file. To run go to /dist/, then /tgui/, then run tgui.exe inside

-Don't edit any files or folders. Don't move anything around

-This is only lightly tested, so expect errors

-Currently designed for 1920x1080 screens, 1920x1080 game resolution, and in fullscreen. App is pixel specific so slight changes can cause fatal errors

-Make sure EFT and BSGlauncher not tunning, and that you've already signed in to your BSG account. Will fail otherwise

Any errors encountered, please let me know.

THIS IS A WIP. IT MAY HURT YOUR PC (Unlikely). I DO NOT TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY POTENTIAL DAMAGE CAUSED TO ANY USER'S MACHINE.

HOW TO RUN THE BOT
<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>

This is an auto-hideout runner


*full run: One run of every node that is to run. 

Preset: Not working currently. Will be able to save presets

Time: Amount of time to run the program for (n * 15min)

Checkup Freq:  Interval between full run attempts

Path to...: Path to BSGLauncher.exe needed to boot game

Generator: How many large fuel containers to load

Water: How many water filters to use

Booze: How many booze to produce

Workbench: Recipe selection and how many times to run it

Intel: Recipe selection and how many times to run it

Medstation: Recipe selection and how many times to run it

Lavatory: Recipe selection and how many times to run it

Nutrition: Recipe selection and how many times to run it

Scav: Recipe selection and how many times to run it

Preset Name: File name for new preset saves

Only required entries are Time, Checkup Freq and Path


Leaving either the recipe selection or run count value empty will not run node

Once all chosen inputs have been loaded, press Start

Verify info on new subscreen, then press Confirm

Once confirmed, do not touch mouse or keyboard until the time has run through

or you want to cancel the run.

Tarkov will auto-boot and open, then once loaded it will start

running hideout full runs. Program will wait 10 sec after every

completed node to give a chance to kill program.


Reminder: This is a beta. It will probably break at some point.

Would not recommend leaving it unattended for long periods of

time for now
